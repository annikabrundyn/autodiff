# Building a deep learning library from scratch

This project was an exercise to better understand the mechanisms like automatic differentiation that power
deep learning libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and JAX.

This implementation relies only on NumPy. 


## How to run

First, install the project:
```bash
cd autodiff
pip install -e .
```
